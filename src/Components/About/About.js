                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always wanted a job that's meaningful to me. For this reason I'm currently 
                    working towards completing the UW-Madison Full-Stack Development Bootcamp. 
                    Prior to this, I worked at a grocery store for several years and completed an 
                    associates degree from Madison Area Technical College. I'm extremely excited to 
                    complete the bootcamp and use the skills I gained to bring ideas to life in a 
                    web/software developer position while continuing to learn on the job. I'm passionate 
                    about building solutions, this is why I want to make an impact at a great company as a 
                    web/software developer.</p>
