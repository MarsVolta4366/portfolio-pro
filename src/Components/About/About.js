                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm passionate about software development, creating, and problem
                    solving. For this reason, I enrolled in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Software Development
                    Certificate program. I graduated from the program on May 7th, 2022 with a software development professional
                    certificate. I also obtained an associates degree in web/software development from Madison Area
                    Technical College in 2019. Since then, I've built full stack web applications and RESTful APIs
                    utilizing the skills I gained during my education.
                    I'm extremely excited to use my skills to bring ideas to life in a
                    web/software developer position while continuing to learn on the job. I'm passionate
                    about building solutions, this is why I want to make an impact at a great company as a
                    web/software developer.</p>
